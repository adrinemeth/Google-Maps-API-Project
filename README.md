# Google-Maps-API-Project
Udacity Design Patterns Course final project
============================================
A single page application featuring a map of a city I would like to visit. 
The map contains added functionality including highlighted locations, third-party data about the locations and a search bar to browse places.

I used the design patterns of the course to develop a manageable code, and I also implement a third-party API that improves the quality of the application.
============================================
What did this project teach me?

--> Interacting with API servers
--> Using separation of concerns (MVC) to develop a maintainable, scalable, easy-to-read codebase.
